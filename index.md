# MUMT 307 Vocal Harmonizer

This vocal harmonizer was created using Max/MSP and MATLAB and was submitted as final project for MUMT 307: Music and Audio Computing 2. Presented by Camilo Gómez and Erica Huynh a.k.a Huynez & Co.

## Introduction
> discuss motivation and goals:
> 
> Goals: Make awesome shit.
> 
> Motivation: At this point, none whatsoever.

## The Interface
> screenshot of the entire interface on Max/MSP
> 
> remember to comment the patch before uploading image

## Pre-processing


>Camilo's zero-crossing vs short-term energy detection
> 
> why do we have to do this?
> 
> include the citations of books and online resources
> 
> include code and graphs

### Comparing VST Plugin to Max External
> describe thought process and choices



| Max/MSP Patcher/Abstraction      | Max External  | VST Plugin (Using MATLAB)   |
|:----------------------|:------------------------|:-----------------------------|
|Less flexibility for sample by sample processing| Sample by sample and frame by frame manipulation|Sample by sample and frame by frame manipulation|  
|Fast prototyping and testing | Laborious to write, test and debug     | Faster prototyping, testing and debugging. audioTestBench included in MATLAB   |
|No coding/compiling         | Max SDK needed          | MATLAB Audio System Toolbox includes generateAudioPlugin function              |






## Pitch-shifting
> on Max/MSP
> 
> decided to have one upper and lower harmony and explain why
> 
> wanted it to be user friendly, so that anyone can use it without requiring music theory background

### gizmo~: Pitch Shift
> how it works, benefits, cons
> 
> include image

### retune~: Pitch Detection
> how it works, benefits, cons
> 
> how it enhances
> 
> explain how pitch shift calculations are made... user friendly
> 
> include images

## Formant Analyses
> god bless us
> 
> #Pray4Huynez2k18

## Effects
> cool stuff
> 
> general image of subpatch

### Delay
> explain parameters
> 
> tapin~ and tapout~

### Feedback
> how it was implemented


## Limitations and Outlook
> what we would have done differently
> 
> limitations in general
> 
> is it usable to the public?

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

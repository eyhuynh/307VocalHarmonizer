## Cross-Synthesis

In order to implement a more natural sounding harmonizer, it is necessary to retain the formants of the original sound. To do this, or at least approximate it, we can do spectral envelope analysis of both signals, and apply the spectral envelope of the original sound to the transposed sound. Due to time constraints, we were not able to generate a real time implementation of the spectral analysis.
